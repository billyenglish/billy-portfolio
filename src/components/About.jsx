                        I'm a front-end software engineer with a passion for creating clean, user-friendly interfaces. My journey began in data
                        center operations at Twitter, where I developed a deep appreciation for systems, precision, and performance. After transitioning
                        back into software, I focused on modern web technologiesâ€”building projects with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.

                    <p className="about-paragraph">
                        I've completed certifications through Meta and Google, and continue to sharpen my skills through The Odin Project and hands-on
                        development. Whether it's crafting responsive layouts or solving complex UI challenges, I'm always learning and striving to build
                        things that are both functional and beautiful.

                        I'm currently open to software engineering roles where I can collaborate, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects
