                    Hey thereâ€”I&apos;m a Software Engineer whose journey began with a passion for software development,
                    but I later expanded my skill set by diving into hardware and system operations. My curiosity about
                    how things work led me to work with infrastructure and scripting, where I gained a deeper understanding
                    of the full tech stack. Today, I create responsive, user-friendly web applications using tools like JavaScript,
                    TypeScript, React, and leverage my experience with Python, C, Bash, and SQL to bring a well-rounded approach to
                    problem-solving. I&apos;m always learning and eager to bring my diverse skill set to a collaborative engineering team.
